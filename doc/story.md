# Story and Design

## Story Outline
Primary outline
1. Character's dad texts character while character is piloting way home from school in shuttle / spacecraft / ship / whatever. Dad asks if son could get a book dad left on an asteroid (dad cant remember where asteroid is though).
2. Son turns around to go look
3. Can't find it and then ship breaks (needs to happen due to mechanics, so that character goes to nearest station)
4. Can't afford new part (very expensive) so offers to trade work for parts, and the dealer agrees and the character gets work with smugglers, using his ship on the condition that he stick with them and do whataver they need until he has paid his debt.
5. Smuggler stuff happens, make it epic
6. Smugglers get involved with civil war, son still waiting for this gig to just end so he can go get the part so he can get the book.
7. Ends up with group fighting for independence (imagine the Browncoats from firefly)
8. Heroic stuff happens
9. Smugglers are like yo its good well help u find book, take son to go find the book, and then drop him off back on the original station where he gest the shuttle
10. When son gets home, finds house abandoned and then opens the book to see that it is in an alien language and contains coordinates in unexplored space.
11. To end the game, character enters coordinates and goes to warp, credits play.

Things to remember:
- Part 5, 8 are not very important, there can be lots of extra stuff here
- Feel free to add allusions and easter eggs, but keep the latter to a reasonable minimum
- Side quests and detailed levels are key to interesting games
- Complexity is not an issue
- Writers should make note of when and where to have what music
- Musicians should be aware of the 12 channel limit (last 3 are for sound effects)
- Do not mess with anything in the `kernel` folder

## Style
Try to keep the game in a scyfi feel, but it does not have to be purely science fiction style. Creativity and oddities make the game feel unique and engaging. Make sure that all windows are formatted the same way typically.
