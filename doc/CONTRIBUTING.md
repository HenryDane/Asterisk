# Contributing Guide

## Commits
When comitting, always briefly describe what you did in the commit message. Additionally, only commit code which compiles properly. Avoid one commit per file or per change -- each commit should contain all files changed in order to meet whatever is described by the commit message.

## Issues
When opening an issue, make sure to make the tile descriptive, and explain what in much greater detail what the actual issue is in the description. Also add all the relevant tags, so that the issue can be properly prioritized.

## Documentation
Be thorough and detailed.
